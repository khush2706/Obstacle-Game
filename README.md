# Obstacle-Game


This is a basic 3D Collision Game created in Unity. This one is my first project in unity. The end goal of the game is to move your player from the starting block to the finishing block without colliding with any obstacles along the way. The player could be easily controlled with basic ARROW KEYS or with W,A,S,D.

# About the Code

* MOVER SCRIPT: Moves the player according to the input provided by the user at a frame-rate independent speed. Also prints the game instructions to the console.

* OBJECT HIT SCRIPT: Changes the color of the obstacle when hit by the player for the first time.

* SCORER SCRIPT: Prints the number of times our player has bumped into the obstacles, in the console.

* DROPPER SCRIPT: Enables the gravity in the obstacles exactly three seconds within the game and thus makes the objects drop three seconds after the game has started.

* SPINNER SCRIPT: Spins the obstacles.
